# Welcome to CADET!

We're excited to introduce the CADET (Capacity Expansion Decision Support Tool) project website. CADET is a flexible optimization framework for distribution network planning, developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

## What is CADET?

CADET helps utilities and planners make capacity-related decisions for electric distribution networks based on multiple objectives:
- Cost minimization
- Reliability improvement
- Resilience enhancement
- Air quality and emissions reduction
- Equitable distribution of benefits
- Carbon footprint reduction
- Hosting capacity maximization

## The CADET Suite

The project consists of three interconnected repositories:

### CADET OPT
The core optimization framework with comprehensive documentation, modular architecture, and support for various distribution planning scenarios.

[Learn more about CADET OPT](/cadet_webpage/projects/cadet-opt)

### CADET Stochastic
Extends CADET with stochastic optimization capabilities for decision-making under uncertainty, particularly for resilience and restoration planning.

### CADET Examples
Practical example implementations and test cases demonstrating real-world applications of the framework.
